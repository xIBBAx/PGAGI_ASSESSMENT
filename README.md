# PGAGI_ASSESSMENT
Project Name: PGAGI Assessment - Data Analysis and Reporting

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a data analysis project completed as part of the PGAGI assessment. The project focuses on analyzing billing data using Python and various data science libraries.

Key Features:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes scripts for loading complex billing data from CSV files and preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizes pandas for EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and key statistics of billing data features.

Visualization: Employs matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing insights from the data, including histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to highlight trends and anomalies.

Report Generation: Uses FPDF to generate a detailed PDF report summarizing findings from the analysis, including key metrics, insights, and actionable recommendations.

Demonstration Files: Provides Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab scripts demonstrating the execution of code for data analysis tasks, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Assessment Highlights:
The project meets the requirements set by PGAGI, showcasing proficiency in data manipulation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and report generation. It includes comprehensive documentation and recorded demonstrations to facilitate evaluation of the implemented tasks.

Next Steps:
Future updates may include enhancements to data processing pipelines, additional visualizations, and integration of advanced machine learning models for predictive analytics.
